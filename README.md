# Horiseon-Project

## Description
- My motivation for updating this project was mainly the lack of organization in the code itself. I wanted to minimize the amount of redundant code and streamline the whole webpage as well as fix any bugs that were present prior to the update.
- I did not build the project but update it to reflect a more organized code.
- I solved bug problems relating to links that did not click and reorganized the whole code to make it more efficient.
- I learned how to refractor code and how to properly organize HTML and CSS files.
